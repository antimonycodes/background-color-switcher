**Prerequisites**:
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

**Instructions**:
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your code editor.
3. Review the HTML code and familiarize yourself with the structure of the document.
4. Open the `style.css` file in your code editor.
5. Review the CSS code and familiarize yourself with the styles applied to the elements.
6. Open the `script.js` file in your code editor.
7. Review the JavaScript code and familiarize yourself with the functionality implemented.
8. Run the project by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

**Code Explanation**:

**HTML**:
- The `index.html` file contains the basic structure of the webpage.
- The `<h1>` element displays the title of the webpage.

- The `<div class="container">` element contains the color swatches.
- Each color swatch is represented by a `<div>` element with a class name (e.g., `grid-item one`).
- The text content of each color swatch represents the color name (e.g., "red").

**CSS**:
- The `style.css` file contains the styles applied to the elements in the webpage.
- The `body` element has a default background color of black.
- The `.container` element has a grid layout with 2 columns and 4 rows.
- Each color swatch has a specific background color and is centered within its grid cell.
